# VSCode Syntax Theme: Miami Arc84
## Miami Arcade 1984
### A VSCode Syntax theme for devs that wanna feel that vaporSynthOutrunWave in Miami.

But seriously, I love this color scheme and decided to make a less intense version of the lite-brite syntax themes that are out there now. I enjoy bright colors but I like them used a little more sparingly. But only a little.

If you think you have some good ideas to help this theme get to the next level, feel free to submit a PR. I want to keep the bright color variation and the amount of it that is used to a minimum so the theme doesn't become a total acid trip.

I should add that this is totally a work in progress. It's not complete but I feel like for HTML/JS/PHP/Ruby/Python etc it should be fine in its current state. As in fine but not perfect.

**Enjoy!**
